# Making 3D Cube C++ and OpenGL 
I have prepared 3D Models that can be rotating all around with keyboard commands. 
The models are:
- Triangle
- Cube
- Rectangle
- Circle
In this project, I have used C++ and OpenGL tools in Visual Studio 2019.
This tools and important files are listed below:
- OpenGL
- glew-2.1.0
- glfw-3.3.4 x64
- freeglut.dll
- glew32.dll


## Demo

## Requirements
GLEW-2.1.0 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nigels-com/glew.git glew
```
- eglew.h
- freeglut.h
- freeglut_ext.h
- freeglut_std.h
- glew.h
- glut.h
- glxew.h
- wglew.h
GLWF
```bash
git clone https://github.com/glfw/glfw.git
```
- glfw3.h
- glw3native.h
## Install and Running

Clone project and open `3D Objects.sln` file with Visual Studio 2019.

`NOTE:` The project requires Visual Studio 2019 C++ packages. It should be installed before execute project.
After, be ensure existing OpenGL files are precisely. 
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/egemengulpinar/3DRotatingObjects-OpenGL.git
```


#### Running

There is not any missing library or tool. The project folder include all requirement file.
Maybe different library version occure some problems, when that happened install the ``` Requirements ```
and copy the important files to project folder.



  Execute  ```main.cpp```   file in ```deneme/src``` folder.

Keyboard commands on the GUI ensure rotation ability on the 3D Cube
- With left-right-up-down arrow on the keyboard the 3D Cube will be rotate.
